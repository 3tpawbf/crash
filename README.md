CashApp is an independently owned banking application that provides services related to money, bitcoin, and stock assets. This study was conducted over 3 months and is on going. A personal account was opened and independently funded using the application’s various functionalities. All funding was handled and deposited by Andrew Branch from labor within the umbrella of a mentally encrypted SOW. Purchases were made using CashApp for daily essentials and fuel for mobile combustion. The vehicle cost was approximated to be $0.20/km. It was used to provide transportation for an elderly client and several anonymous occupants displaced relative to the COVID epidemic’s fallout and local response by the community’s emergency teams. <br>

After 3 months of testing the following statistics can be gleaned from the data pool of the CashApp GUI. Out of 15 different randomly chosen stocks the total gain was measured as 1.53%. TSM had the leading returns ($1.73) while FXI was the trailing return value (-$1.27). The median stock return was DXJ ($0.00) and the average of the returns from purchased stocks was measured to be $1.57 the median return was $0.00 (DXJ). There are other statistics available within the GUI as well as multiple functionalities that could be experimented with by scholars and advisors that wish to make money by spending money on essentials such as toilet paper, water, food, or transportation. <br>

The above gains/losses were measured on a fiscal oscilloscope that was built by the creators of CashApp. After purchasing stocks, one is able to measure the relative gains/losses of the markets with respect to a reading of the system between the time that the stocks were originally purchased and the report date. I was not paid to provide this report and I was not directed on how or what to report. There are risks associated with investing in any market. This is not an endorsement to buy any stock. This report should be considered zero warranty with respect to fiscal stability of investments.
