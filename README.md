CashApp is an independently owned banking application that provides services related to money, bitcoin, and stock assets. This study was conducted over 3 months and is on going. A personal account was opened and independently funded using the application’s various functionalities. All funding was handled and deposited by Andrew Branch from labor within the umbrella of a mentally encrypted SOW. Purchases were made using CashApp for daily essentials and fuel for mobile combustion. The vehicle cost was approximated to be $0.20/km. It was used to provide transportation for an elderly client and several anonymous occupants displaced relative to the COVID epidemic’s fallout and local response by the community’s emergency teams. <br>
